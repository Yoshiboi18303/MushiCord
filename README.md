# MushiCord
A Revamp of Mushiboi_Bot, which was coded in Python by me!

**ALL THE CODE HERE IS CURRENT, THINGS MAY CHANGE DURING UPDATES!**

## Invite the bot
Click [here](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=868715163962990622&scope=bot&permissions=4332047424) to invite MushiCord to your server!

---

## Using the bot
Start by joining a Voice Channel in your server, then run `mshi?join` and MushiCord should connect to your Voice Channel, then find your favorite song on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), or [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com) and then run `mshi?play <url>` to start playing music!
> Give the bot a moment after you run the command, as it needs to download an entire webpage (and initialize a player if one doesn't exist yet for your server).
